Have you ever wanted to make your own custom DIY Car Thing? Well, it's great that you've come to the right place!  

**ArduinoThing** is a small program written in **MicroPython** and **C++**.  

This project is compatible with both **ESP32 (WROOM32)** and **Arduino UNO**, and you can customize it to display whatever you want on an **LCD Display** or other devices like an OLED Display, etc.
